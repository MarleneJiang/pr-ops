        Once you have filled the form and submitted this issue, we will run automated validation on the plugin.

        :+1: If everything goes well, a new label `validation/succeeded` will be added and the alicebot docs will authorise the publication of the plugin to the marketplace.

        :confused: If there are issues, you will see details in comments on the issue and information about how to fix them and re-run validation.
